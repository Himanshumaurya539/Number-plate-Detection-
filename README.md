# Number-plate-Detection-
 I’m excited to share my project on Number Plate Detection, which uses OpenCV’s cv2.CascadeClassifier and a pre-trained Haar Cascade to detect vehicle number plates in real-time. Combining image processing and machine learning, this system offers an efficient and accurate solution for identifying license plates.
